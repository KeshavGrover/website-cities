			<div class="contentBlock"><h2>Inclusive Design</h2>
				<p>Building new cities from the ground up is a complex problem. People are diverse and have unique needs, the technology is moving quickly, and the context is rapidly changing. Investment in designing for average populations and creating fixed standards and design criteria leads us to ignore the changes, deny the complexity, and exclude the diversity.</p>

				<p>Inclusive design begins with no predetermined end point and no generalized success criteria but arrives at greater innovation, flexibility, and general usability. The inclusive design framework is intended to be more like a trellis that supports organic growth and provides a foundation from which to innovate and evolve. The three dimensions of the framework are:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Recognize, respect, and design for human uniqueness and variability.</li>
					<li>Use inclusive, open & transparent processes, and co-design with people who have a diversity of perspectives, including people that can’t use or have difficulty using the current designs.</li>
					<li>Realize that you are designing in a complex adaptive system.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="contentBlock"><h2>Co-design</h2>
				<p>With the current pace of urban development, new neighbourhoods and towns are established in just a few years. Residents are generally not involved in the process of designing these spaces, the neighbourhoods are created based on some average population’s wishes and people start moving in. The burden is then placed on the individual residents’ to adapt to these normalized living spaces and find work arounds to make them meet their unique needs. </p>

				<p>The practice of co-design tries to bridge this gap. It allows citizens to actively participate in iterative cycles of design from conception to completion to have a direct input into the creation of cities that meet their needs. Although the best co-design happens when diverse perspectives are brought together, it is almost impossible to invite all citizens or their representative perspectives into a co-design process. To overcome this challenge, addressing the edge scenario is often the best design strategy. If you reach the edge, the design will also work better for the center and will be more flexible and generous. Co-designing cities with citizens whose needs are typically considered to be “at the margin” leads to integrating inclusive design and accessibility into design of cities right from the start and minimize the need for segregated special solutions or expensive future retro-fitting.</p>
