			<div class="contentBlock"><h2>Inclusive Design</h2>
				<p>Building new cities from ground up is a complex problem, people who will reside in those future cities are diverse and have their unique needs and preferences, the technology is moving too fast, and the context is rapidly changing. Thus, investment in fix standards and design criteria leads us to ignore the changes, deny the complexity, and exclude the diversity. Inclusive design begins with no predetermined end point and no generalized success criteria but arrives at greater innovation, flexibility, and general usability. Employing an inclusively designed process will achieve a more lasting and productive change than a checklist of design criteria.</p></div>
			<div class="contentBlock"><h2>Co-design</h2>
				<p>With the current pace of urban development, we have noticed new neighbourhoods and towns pop out and get established in just a few years. Sometimes we wonder who the developers are and for whom they are building these new neighborhoods. We wonder if the future residents had an opportunity to express what their needs are and what kind of neighbourhood they want to live in. Most often this is not the case and there is a gap between urban developers and the residents. New neighbourhoods are developed based on the needs of average population and people start moving in. Then, the burden is on the residents shoulder to adapt to these normalized living spaces and find work arounds to make them meet their unique needs and preferences.</p> 

<p>The practice of co-design tried to bridge this gap and approaches urban development from the perspective of people. It allows citizens to actively participate in the design process and have a direct input into the creation of spaces, artifacts, interfaces and services to meet their needs. In this process, citizens are experts in their experience and get involved throughout the design process, from conception to completion.</p>

<p>The best co-design process happens when the broadest range of diverse perspectives are brought together. However, it is almost impossible to invite all citizens or their representative perspectives that build the city’s fabric into a co-design process. To overcome this challenge, addressing the edge scenario is often the best design strategy. If you reach the edge, the design will also work better for the center. It will be more flexible and generous. If you design with the edge user, someone who isn’t an edge user will have more choices and won’t leave your solution when their need or context changes. Co-designing cities with citizens whose needs are typically considered to be “at the margin” leads to integrating inclusive thinking and accessibility into the project right from the planning phase and minimize the need for segregated special solutions or expensive future retro-fitting.</p>

			<p>We are creating this project through iterative cycles of co-design with marginalized communities, people with disabilities and supporting organisations. If you are interested in being involved please contact us.</p>
			<p>You can also sign up for our mailing list to participate in threaded conversations about this project, and be informed of the related events.
