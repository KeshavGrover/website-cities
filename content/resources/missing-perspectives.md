During our outreach process, we found it very difficult to engage specific groups, such as the indigenous community, the black community, LGBTQ2S, religious minorities, and different ethnicities. Some of these groups expressed consultation fatigue as the main reason for their lack of interest to participate. They were brought into different initiatives and asked for their opinion, however, they didnâ€™t see their perspectives being integrated. Some others had experienced tokenism where they were only recruited to give the appearance of diverse engagement without their input being genuinely considered. Overall, they could not see how their participation might benefit their community and had no strong motivation or incentive to participate in a co-design process.

As we progressed, we also recognized that we often overlook the fact that marginalized groups, similar to any other community, have diverse needs and experience impurities, discrimination, exclusion, and hierarchies. Thus, within marginalized communities, there were people experiencing exclusion. Identifying those outliers within marginalized communities was a fundamental challenge. We could only address this issue with the assistance of people and organizations who had a deep understanding of those communities and were aware of their complex interrelationships.

### TRY

- During your invitation process, be honest and transparent about the project objectives, process, and outcomes.
- Clearly communicate how the collected information from the participants will be handled and shared with the community.
- Clearly describe any financial or non financial incentives for participation.
- Work with communities and organizations who are working with marginalized groups to better understand their context.
- Engage marginalized groups in a discussion about how they experience exclusion within their communities.
