title: "Co-design the topic"
description: "Working with collaborators helps to define a topic that is relevant to their needs and context."
---

Planning a collaborative activity usually starts with identifying the questions or topics that need to be further explored. This could be an overwhelming step, as these topics may be too abstract and entangled with other issues, or they may be too specific, structured, or biased. Exploring topics in contexts/cultures that are different from yours is another challenge. Ensuring the selected topics are relevant, understandable and not triggering or offensive for the participating community are some important aspects to consider.

Working with participants to collaboratively define a topic can help to overcome many of these challenges. In doing so, planners bring together a group of participants/ collaborators to discuss different perspectives and share questions/issues that are important to them and their communities. Through this collaborative process, the planning team gains a better understanding of their participantsâ€™ context, culture, and accessibility requirements. This mutual understanding enables the planning team to organize the co-design around a topic that is more relevant to the community and it is not exclusive of any group.

TRY

1. Select a general theme or area that you would like to explore with co-design
1. Invite participants to an open process of exploring and refining that theme
    1. If possible, directly invite participants to join the topic co-design otherwise, collaborate with the organizations/ groups that are in direct contact with the participants.
    1. This can be done in-person, or via online tools, such as shared google documents to enable remote collaborators to contribute ideas.
1. Work with your collaborators to discuss issues that are important to them and their community
1. Work together to group similar ideas, prioritize them, and mutually agree upon a topic
1. Work together to ensure the final topic is easily understandable and gives participants a good place to start their discussion.
