Planning a collaborative activity usually starts with identifying the questions or topics that need to be further explored. This could be an overwhelming phase, as these topics may be too abstract, entangled with other issues, or too specific, structured, and biased. Other challenges may emerge as you explore topics in contexts/cultures that are different from yours. Ensuring the selected topics are relevant, understandable and not triggering for the participating communities are some important aspects to consider.

Defining a topic in collaboration with your participants can help to overcome many of these challenges. The planning team can bring together a group of participants/collaborators to discuss different perspectives and share questions/issues important to them and their communities. Through this collaborative process, the planning team gains a better understanding of their participantsâ€™ context, culture, and accessibility requirements. This mutual understanding enables the planning team to organize the co-design around a topic that is more relevant to the community and it is not exclusive of any group.

### TRY

- Select a general theme that you would like to explore through this co-design activity
- Invite participants to an open process of exploring and refining the selected theme.
- Work directly with the participants when possible, otherwise work with groups and organizations that advocate for your participants. This can be done in-person, or via collaborative online tools, such as shared google documents to enable remote collaboration.
- Discuss the following questions with your collaborators to refine the theme (share personal experiences):
    - How do you define this theme from your perspective?
    - What are the different characteristics/aspects of the theme?
    - What are the main values related to this theme?
    - Who are the people involved?
    - What kinds of activities are happening related to this theme?
    - What challenges/gaps are being experienced?
- Use your responses to further refine the theme and further break it down to sub-themes
- Work with your collaborators to select one area.
- Ensure your final theme is clear, easy to understand, and supported by additional materials for further guidance and clarification.
