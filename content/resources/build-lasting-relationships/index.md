Our community outreach connected us to organizations/groups in Toronto who were interested in running their embedded co-design activities but had reservations about our initiative. Some organizations expressed concern regarding the privacy of their members should they participate and share personal information with us. Others wondered what sort of impact their involvement would have on the project and their community. 


As requested, our team provided detailed information regarding privacy and ownership of contributions, details on participant roles, expectations, and commitments. We clearly communicated our limitations with regards to budget and resources while offering assistance and support whenever possible (e.g. providing refreshments, meeting space, supplies). Sharing activities from previous events, and encouraging interested groups to participate in the development of topics and activities also helped in building stronger relationships. 


We reassured our partners that we would use all our means to minimize any additional effort on their end and would provide assistance with the planning, execution and facilitation of the activities at any point. Clearly communicating with our partners that we aim to build long term relationships with their community allowed us to look beyond the current project and envision the opportunities made possible through our collaboration. Sending the final reports to our participants and partners, communicating how their input will impact the Sidewalk project, and encouraging them to contribute to this co-design resource are several examples of how we try to strengthen our relationship with the community.
