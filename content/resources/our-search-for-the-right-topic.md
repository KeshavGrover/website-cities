For each of our co-design events, we had to explore different topics that were relevant and contextual to our participating communities. Throughout this process, we noticed that abstract topics required more scaffolding and participants had difficulty understanding them. For example, our first co-design sessions with Sidewalk labs focused on inclusive feedback mechanisms that could be implemented in the context of smart cities. This topic was too abstract and tied to new technologies that were hard to envision for most participants. As a result, participants developed their own interpretation of the topic and most of their ideas included solutions to real life urban issues, such as the transit or health care system in Toronto rather than on mechanisms or tools that enabled an inclusive feedback process for citizens.

As we progressed and worked more closely with our collaborators, we learned that we cannot explore all different aspects of a topic in one activity. First, we needed to unpack a topic and only select a few pieces to be explored in a co-design activity. And for those selected areas, we had to ensure they were not too specific, their language was simplified, and they were supported by sufficient and clear instructions.
