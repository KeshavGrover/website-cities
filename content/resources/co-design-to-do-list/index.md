When planning a co-design event, the organizing team has a wide range of responsibilities. Some of the tasks, such as booking a space or booking an accessibility service should be done at least a few weeks prior to the event. Inviting participants should also be done in advance to give them enough time to plan their trip and arrange any required accommodations. This is particularly important for participants who need to book interveners, personal assistants or special transportation services.
