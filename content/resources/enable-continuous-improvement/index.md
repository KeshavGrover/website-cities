In common practice, product design takes on a linear approach, from the inception of an idea to the design, production and then release of a product into the market. The end users receive a finished product with limited room for improvement in the case where  their circumstances change (e.g. changes in abilities, preferences, contexts, etc.). This sometimes renders the product impractical for the user, and lessens its value.


In an ongoing co-design process, however, people from the community are involved in the design process to participate in a generation of solutions that address their changing needs. As people with lived experiences of disability, exclusion, and marginalization take part in these discussions, they are able to envision solutions that are flexible and have the capacity to be modified by future users. 


When organizing the documented discussions from co-design events, it is very important to highlight these elements and qualities that enable people to continue to change and expand the end products. These elements should be clearly communicated in the final reports and incorporated in the final designs to support people in becoming their own designers and enabling them to iterate on those products according to their capabilities and preferences.


### TRY

- Invite diverse members of the community to co-design sessions.
- Develop a system to enable continued feedback from the community on ideas generated in co-design sessions. 
- Actively incorporate feedback into existing ideas and provide the public with the means to create their own iterations and engage in their own design solutions.
