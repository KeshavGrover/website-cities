To share our findings with the public, the team created summaries of the events and a detailed report of all the synthesized ideas from any of our co-design sessions. Documented notes were synthesized into written documents using a narrative/ storytelling approach, and all ideas were appropriately attributed to responsible groups. The written documents were posted on our website for open access for the participants and others that may be interested. 


Artifacts and rough notes created by participants from our led co-design sessions were also incorporated in the online documents along with the reports and made available to the public. However, the artifacts and rough notes from our embedded co-design activities were not shared publicly as part of our agreement to protect the identity of participants in the community. For these co-design sessions, only the synthesized ideas were shared with the public. In addition to the public platform, the final reports were shared directly with our participants and their feedback was encouraged.
