Including people who have lived experience of disability and marginalization was our main focus when organizing each of our co-design sessions. However, during those sessions, we noticed that it was very difficult for diverse participants to work together as they had conflicting needs, attitudes, and perspectives.

These differences became apparent when people were brought together and asked to collaborate in small groups. Sometimes their interactions led to negative power dynamics, division of groups, side conversations, and disengagement of members. For example, in one session, two participants with vision loss became engrossed in discussing their ideas and unconsciously excluded the other two members of their team. Eventually, the other two members formed their own group to share their perspectives. This made us more aware of the conflicts that may arise in groups due to differences in participants’ perspectives and experiences.

Providing participants with an opportunity to get to know each other prior to engaging in an activity (e.g. introductions, warm up activities), giving the option to change groups, and communicating an outline of their tasks improved group dynamics. Integrating interpreters/ personal assistants in the session, offering material in alternative formats, and making further examples/instructions available also facilitated the workflow where there were conflicting needs.

### TRY

- Be observant of group dynamics and how members interact with each other.
- Provide assistance for groups that have several members with extreme needs.
- Provide simple and clear instruction about the process and how participants’ contribution can impact the community.
- Have supportive examples/ instructions ready for anyone needed extra guidance.
- Offer materials in alternative format and make, and offer to make it available prior to the event upon attendees’ request.
- Integrate translators, ASL interpreters, audio describers, personal assistant or anyone else who can enable your participants to equally participate.
