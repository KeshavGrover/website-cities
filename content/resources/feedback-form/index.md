The feedback form is a good way to include participant insights in the co-design process. The participants can share their experience at the co-design event and provide feedback on aspects they appreciated and aspects they would like the organizers and facilitators to improve on. This form should be provided in alternative formats to allow all participants access the content and provide their input and comments. Participants should also be  given enough time to fill this form out, either at the session or afterward. This is an optional task and participants should have the option to skip it entirely or use any other form of communication to give their feedback. Extending the opportunity for participants to share their opinions will foster trust and solidify relationships.
