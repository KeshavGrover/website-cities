Through our process, we learned that an activity should be easy to understand and not require an extensive learning process. In our initial co-design session, we used a “Journey Mapping” activity, which was new and confusing to most of participants. Some people required more instruction while others felt constrained by its structure. Learning from this experience, we started using conventional worksheets. Most participants found this format to be simple and engaging, however, those with vision loss, physical or learning disabilities were unable to participate in note taking.


Conflicting needs of participants was a challenge for some groups. Participants with vision loss or inability to physically interact with materials had difficulty participating in prototyping. Those with vision loss had difficulty following discussions that involved visual description of ideas. Also, some of the tools used (e.g. sticky notes/flip charts) were inaccessible for those who could not write (e.g. blind, paralyzed).


Collaborating with partner organizations, helped us to better incorporate participant needs in the activities. Our partners at the deaf culture centre, reminded us that some of their members primarily communicate using American Sign Language, and suggested checklists to minimize writing. During this activity, we grouped hearing and deaf participants together to enable note taking and provided ASL interpretation to facilitate communication. We tried to minimize barriers to participation, by sharing the written/visual material with participants in advance, and providing activities in multiple modalities.

### TRY

- When developing activities, reach out to different groups, communities, individuals or any other resources to acquire knowledge about the needs and capabilities of your participants to help you tailor the activity.
- Provide multi-modal representations of the activity so they are accessible for all participants.
- Modify any activity that is solely based on one mode of interaction, such as writing, hearing, seeing, touching, listening to include other modalities.
- When grouping participants, make sure to minimize conflicts within group members by providing tools that meet the needs of each participant.
- Encourage volunteers/facilitators/staff to join different groups to provide assistance with physical tasks.
