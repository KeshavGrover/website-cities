Engaging marginalized communities and people who have often been excluded from the design process requires building a trusting relationship. Many of these communities experience consultation fatigue due to the tokenistic nature of their involvement in design projects in which important design decisions have already been made. Often these groups are only approached to achieve a check on the equity and diversity policy checklists.

Those involved in the design process should approach people with humility and respect. Treating participants as the real expertes in the field, carefully listening to their concerns, and being willing to learn from their experiences is the first important step to build trust. This would give participants agency and enables them to re-define the process in a way that works best for them and their community.

Transparent communication about the project’s opportunities, risks, shortcomings, and limitations helps the prospective collaborators/participants to recognize that the process is not biased and there is still a chance for influencing it. A clear discussion about the terms of participation, roles, responsibilities, and incentives as well as aiming to establish a long term relationship with the collaborators/participants helps to build deeper relationships with the collaborators/participants.

### TRY

- Be honest and clearly explain different aspects of the projects, its risks, opportunities, problems, and your concerns about it.
- Ask collaborators to discuss what their concerns are related to this project and what they want to see changed.
- Ask them to share with you what they would like to achieve if they decide to participate in this project.
- Clearly discuss what you expect from them in terms of roles, responsibilities, commitment, resources, and time and explain what they would get in return.
- Allow them to discuss this within their community and come back to you with more questions and points for clarification.
- Include partners/collaborators in developing topics and activities for co-design to tailor them to their community’s needs.
- Offer support, assistance and resources whenever possible to make it easier for your collaborators to run their co-design events.
