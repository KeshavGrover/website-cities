Once you have a topic, it is very important to work with your collaborators to clearly define what your objectives are and how a collaborative approach can help to achieve them. These goals can be iterated and refined as you go through the process. Your team can always refer back to these objectives to ensure your work is aligned with the goals you have established for your project.

There are situations where collaborators have different objectives in mind. These differences can impact the entire process, make it harder to develop activities, and lead to inconsistencies when communicating the project with your participants. If it is impossible to agree upon a shared set of objectives, try to plan multiple collaborative activities to address different goals with separate activities.
