Here, you can find a link to all the worksheets that the IDRC has used to conduct either led or embedded co-design activities. Each set of worksheets has a particular topic, includes a series of tasks, and recommends a specific timeframe to complete the activity. We have also provided a link to detailed reports here to explain how each of these worksheets have been applied and what kind of information they have helped generate. These worksheets are licensed under CC by 4.0 and can be directly used, remixed, repurposed or transformed as long as proper attribution is given.
