We've gone through all of the great ideas from the co-design sessions and selected 8 of them to prototype at the September 21 Hackathon. For each one, we've prepared a design challenge, which lists the required features and intended use cases for the project.

For more details about the Hackathon, and to apply to take part, please see the [Accessible City Hackathon Application announcement]({{< relref "/ideas/accessible-city-hackathon-app.html" >}}).

### [Project #1: Audible incoming traffic warnings @ intersections]({{< relref "/hackathon/prd/audible-incoming-traffic-warnings.md" >}})

An occupancy sensor (pressure sensor, camera, etc.) in the street that lets people know about someone approaching on a bicycle or car if they're preparing to cross the street and / or currently in the street. [Read more]({{< relref "/hackathon/prd/audible-incoming-traffic-warnings.md" >}})

### [Project #2: Tranquil Refuge]({{< relref "/hackathon/prd/tranquil-refuge.md" >}})

A place that people that need a physical or sensory reprieve from the environment can go to rest and recharge. Potential to give priority access to people with accessibility needs. [Read more]({{< relref "/hackathon/prd/tranquil-refuge.md" >}})

### [Project #3: Construction Advisory Beacon Messages]({{< relref "/hackathon/prd/construction-advisory-beacon-messages.md" >}})

An advisory message sent from a beacon informing people of construction impediment(s) on the path. [Read more]({{< relref "/hackathon/prd/construction-advisory-beacon-messages.md" >}})

### [Project #4: Self-driving cars for sub-emergency medical visits]({{< relref "/hackathon/prd/self-driving-cars-for-sub-emergency-medical-visits.md" >}})

A dependable audio interface for ordering non-emergency medical transport. [Read more]({{< relref "/hackathon/prd/self-driving-cars-for-sub-emergency-medical-visits.md" >}})

### [Project #5: Augmented reality park feedback experience]({{< relref "/hackathon/prd/augmented-reality-park-feedback.md" >}})

Providing actionable information about a public park — features and amenities — and a means for reporting maintenance issues within the park to responsible parties in an accessible, easy manner. [Read more]({{< relref "/hackathon/prd/augmented-reality-park-feedback.md" >}})

### [Project #6: Rumble Pavement]({{< relref "/hackathon/prd/rumble-pavement.md" >}})

A dynamic audible indication of where the sidewalk (pedestrian-only section) ends and potentially dangerous bike or vehicular traffic starts. [Read more]({{< relref "/hackathon/prd/rumble-pavement.md" >}})

### [Project #7: Tactile Sidewalk Wayfinding Strip]({{< relref "/hackathon/prd/tactile-sidewalk-wayfinding-strip.md" >}})

A continuous tactile path on all sidewalks that provides wayfinding to and contextual, place-based information about the nearest transit stop. [Read more]({{< relref "/hackathon/prd/tactile-sidewalk-wayfinding-strip.md" >}})

### [Project #8: AI Floor Describer]({{< relref "/hackathon/prd/ai-floor-describer.md" >}})

Auto-generate an audio description of a one-floor floorplan, including the elevators / stairs / washrooms / seating area / doors. [Read more]({{< relref "/hackathon/prd/ai-floor-describer.md" >}})
