At this year's [DEEP conference](https://deep.idrc.ocadu.ca/) (October 12-13, 2018), the Inclusive Cities team presented an overview of their co-design process and shared their challenges and learnings from doing multiple different embedded or led co-design sessions in different contexts. This presentation aimed to open up the discussion about doing co-design at the city level and also to provide an introduction for the following co-design activity.

The Inclusive Cities co-design session started at 1:30 on Friday and ended around 4:30 pm. Five IDRC members facilitated the activity. About 35 people including individuals from the Greater Toronto Area, Colombia, Mexico, and Nigeria participated in this collaborative activity. The goal of this activity was to bring a diverse group of people together to explore different collaborative approaches for public engagement and for actively involving public in the design and planning of their cities.
