title: "Image Description for the Co-design Session #3 Prototype Discussion Whiteboard"
---

Whiteboard of notes on the discussion of the 5 prototypes. Each group described their prototype, presented their initial process, and discussed the critiques they received.

## A Team group

* Smarties box & plasticine {{< arrow >}} changes in level through multimodal cues
* Domes {{< arrow >}} rough plating on current streets
* Heating, lighting, colour
* Holes in domes, depression on ground (hollow)
* Indicates central groove
* Tactile plate {{< arrow >}} ice cream sandwich

### Revisions/Discussion

* Warning plate {{< arrow >}} warn people that a ramp/drop is approaching
* Constructed like an ice cream sandwich
  * Cane users can hear that they’re on it 
* Haptic features {{< arrow >}} circuitry inside and underneath 
* Heating plate
* How many lights? {{< arrow >}} solicit user feedback
* Will heating interfere with other circuitry
* Navigate to plate {{< arrow >}} meant to indicate upcoming slope {{< arrow >}} plate at top of slope {{< arrow >}} find feel with tactility of bumps 
  * Metal because of durability and conductivity

### Criticisms

* Too much happening at once
* Might cause issues for people with cognitive problems/mental health...etc
* Tactile bumps for people who have difficulty lifting legs may be a problem
* Constant illumination may be over stimulating {{< arrow >}} change to gentle illumination
* No vibration {{< arrow >}} tactile cues enough
* Groove maintained to guide canes
* Keep bumps only at edges for smoother movement for all
* Holes for heating/drainage/light {{< arrow >}} hole are very small
* Hollow space changes sound regardless how you navigate
* Bumps are like current tactile bumps but smoothed out a little for smoother movement for all
	
## Cats and Dogs group

* Wayfinding to get to building
* Little bot to navigate inside building
* Input your needs (wheelchair, visual...etc)
* Can pre-program on phone and tap robot
* Can sign (ASL) to it and use voice control
* Folds down at the end of day
* Vending machine for bot
* Bot can wait for you or it has a recall button to come back when you’re ready
* Like R2D2, stays within 3 ft of body

### Revisions/Discussion

* Could carry parsels? {{< arrow >}} no because small
* Can be costly {{< arrow >}} will be cheaper when scaled up/mass produced
* People can trip or fall on it if it’s so small
* Has auditory output
* Doesn’t require personal info {{< arrow >}} just preferences
* Stored on site {{< arrow >}} connected to larger system (about 3 ft tall to prevent tripping and easier use)
* Battery powered 
* Has emergency mode and leads to nearest exit
* How not to freak out pets {{< arrow >}} if it becomes common you can train it to become used to it
* Automation eventually leads to savings
* It’s like google maps but inside buildings
* Feedback and monitoring system for maintenance
* 3 laws of robots

## Challenging Hedgehog group

* App to help switch between modes of transportation
* Real time data
* Add preferences for things to avoid
* Open source real time data
* Personal profile that you can access at bus stop if your phone dies/you don’t have a phone
* 1st screen {{< arrow >}} location and destination {{< arrow >}} mode of transport
* Give other info {{< arrow >}} interests, hobbies, good snow removal, construction (detailed information), fallen trees, links to things (311/911) 
* “In-Struct”

### Revisions/Discussion

* People who don’t have access to tech ($$/learning disability…) include links for 311
* If phone dies {{< arrow >}} charging stations which has all the ports
* Multimodal notifications {{< arrow >}} multilingual
* Problems with wifi and data costs money
* Keep simple and easy to use 
  * Focus on GPS aspect
  * Curb cuts and construction
* Kiosk {{< arrow >}} find info and charge device

## Group#2 group

* Cross street from streetcar to get to elevator
* App that works with navigation
* Safe passage
* Button activate light system
* Braille floor and beacons to get to elevator
* Can use app to interact
* Announcement to be mindful
* Seated areas on platform
* Raised platform (ramps all around)

### Revision/Discussion

* No physical barriers {{< arrow >}} was intentional, trying not to exclude people, system meant to draw attention to be wary of people crossing, should be pedestrians only
* What happens when elevator is broken 
  * Info will be in embedded app
* How to scale? {{< arrow >}} network of paths?
* What about snow? {{< arrow >}} robots or heated

## Assorted Barrier Busters group

* Interview next day 
* Access app for accessibility in and out of buildings
* Voice activation
* Set up for automation at thresholds
* External {{< arrow >}} satellite vehicle comes out to greet and welcome you
* Helps bring person in
* Elevator is accessible
  * Spacious
  * Control panels on the side (not on door side)
  * Height accessible buttons
  * Buttons raised and have braille
* Display outside elevator to tell which one is coming and how long 
  * Beeps a few seconds before it arrives

### Revision/Discussion

* Deaf people {{< arrow >}} visual display screens
* Smartphone/app {{< arrow >}} fob with 3 buttons and the ability to pre-set custom preferences
* New system {{< arrow >}} learning curve? Building costs?
* Employer gives people phones
* Like the idea of buttons on side instead of on door
